# JaDis

JaDis (Java Disassembler) is a simple tool to read and analyze the contents of java class files.

## Features

### Current Features
- Reading the outer structure of the class file
- Dumping this structure
- Attribute parsing (Some attributes are still TODO)
- Bytecode parsing (Code attribute)

### TODO
- Print bytecode in a basic assembly language (jasmin?)
- Print java source code
- Write classfiles (to allow classfile manipulation)

## Contributing
Contributors are welcome. To contribute you need an Java IDE with Maven and Lombok support.

Most Java IDEs have Maven support built in or as an easy to install plugin (for example, Eclipse has m2e).

Lombok provides support for the most IDEs [here](http://projectlombok.org/download.html)
