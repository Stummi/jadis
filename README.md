## Contributing
Contributors are welcome. To contribute you need an Java IDE with Maven and Lombok support.

Most Java IDEs have Maven support built in or as an easy to install plugin (for example, Eclipse has m2e).

Lombok provides support for the most IDEs [here](http://projectlombok.org/download.html)
